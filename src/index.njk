        One way to wonder is to expand an experience into questions that reign unanswerable.  In asking these questions and emptying oneself to their unanswerability, one can allow for awe to fill them.  I believe that moving through the world filled with awe allows for greater responsivity and grace for omnipresent, sometimes terrifying, ambiguity. I expand on these ideas more below, and then offer some concrete methods for increasing the amount of wonder and awe you experience.

       An easy example of wonder leading into awe - fresh snow glistening on a fire escape. It is easy to expand this experience; to wonder at it. Where does it come from? Its lightness seems to resist gravity with impossible ease. Each snowflake is a unique masterpiece of unknown origin, how are they made? Why? Each one of these questions is, at some level, unanswerable - you could pick apart pieces in a physics classroom, but eventually you would get to a “science doesn’t know”. Herein comes the awe.
       
       
       <br><br>When you meet the ultimate unanswerability of a question, you can allow yourself awe - being humbled, amazed by that which you cannot understand. And people get excited about fresh snow. Instagram blows up. So do my group chats. One is inclined to take pictures, write about it. One is moved by the experience. My premise is that more experiences can be moving in that way, if we practice that skill. 

 <br><br>Practicing this experience allows for more grace for all that we do not know.

       Another example - dirty snow lining the sides of some New York street. Here it is often easier to feel annoyance or disgust at the experience. But wonder remains possible, by expanding the experience into questions about how and why this moment came to be as it was. I think of the song of the city, the one that melts the snow away: the huffing bass of the sanitation trucks, the bells of the delivery drivers, the idle chatter of second dates.  The way these vibrations intermingle in a rhythm ordained by no power I can imagine, but whose result I see in front of me. Here I am, feeling awe towards, moved by an experience that might otherwise invite more negative valence. 

<br><br>
Every moment we are confronted by familiar, likely neutral scenes. You can choose wonder, you can choose awe. 

It’s my hypothesis that practicing more wonder and awe in your life both increases your joy (obvious good) and increases your appreciation for the unknown, which is an important part of psychological resilience.
<br><br>
I think of the latter part of that - the tolerenace for general ambiguity, because you can choose wonder and awe even in stressful situations, where the mind wants to foreclose on options.
For instance, when experiencing anxiety, one tends to jump into imagining the worst possible scenario. But practicing wonder and awe allows you to practice not jumping to conclusions. To practice viewing the unknown in a beautiful light.
