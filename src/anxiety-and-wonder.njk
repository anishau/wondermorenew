        Anxiety and wonder both share roots in curiosity. But to distinguish the two, we can pay close attention to the kinds of questions I was asking in the previous essay. I was asking questions that were unanswerable, asking questions of complexity beyond human (or artificial) intellect. For instance “ Where does it [snow] come from? Its lightness seems to resist gravity with impossible ease. Each snowflake is a unique masterpiece of unknown origin, how are they made? Why? “
<br><br>
Anxiety asks questions that are more fundamentally answerable.
<br><br>
When feeling anxious about, say, the possibility of your plane crashing, you find yourself wondering about a great many things: turbulence, a vehicular malfunction, a pilot who’s decided to end it all, a terrorist attack, the list goes on. These are all events that either will or won’t happen. In the moment you don’t know which, so you find yourself succumbing to the awful-ness of the anxious experience. 
<br><br>
In order to instead yield to the awe of the experience, one must allow room for themself to ask different questions. To wonder in this way one could ask questions like how does the airplane stay aloft? How do air traffic routing mechanisms maintain such a complex system? Who are all these other passengers and where could they be going? When you suspend yourself in the unknowability of these questions, you fill yourself with awe. This pushes out room for the awe-ful experience of anxiety.  
<br><br>
Anxiety is intolerant of the unknown—it demands certainty, even when certainty is impossible. Wonder, on the other hand, delights in the unknown. By choosing wonder, we retrain our minds to find joy in uncertainty rather than fear.
