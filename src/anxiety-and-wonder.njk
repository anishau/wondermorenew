        <p class="essay-text">
          When anxiety arises, it often feels like a contraction - a narrowing of possibilities into worst-case scenarios. The mind races down familiar paths of worry, each thought reinforcing the next. But what if we could meet this experience differently? What if we could approach anxiety with the same expansive curiosity we bring to moments of wonder?
        </p>

        <p class="essay-text">
          Consider how wonder works: it opens us to questions without demanding immediate answers. When we wonder at something - be it a sunset or a mathematical equation - we allow ourselves to not know, to sit with mystery. This is precisely the opposite of what anxiety asks of us, which is to resolve uncertainty as quickly as possible, often through catastrophizing.
        </p>

        <p class="essay-text">
          The practice I'm suggesting is this: when anxiety appears, try to meet it with wonder rather than resistance. What is this sensation in your body? Where did it come from? What stories is your mind spinning, and how did it learn to tell these particular tales? Each of these questions invites exploration rather than escape.
        </p>

        <p class="essay-text">
          This isn't about dismissing anxiety or pretending it's pleasant. Rather, it's about bringing curiosity to our relationship with anxiety itself. In doing so, we might find that the very act of wondering creates some space around the anxiety - not to make it go away, but to relate to it differently.
